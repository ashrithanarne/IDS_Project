This project draws primarily on structured media metadata from large-scale journalism research datasets that systematically measure global news coverage. Prior research in journalism studies has demonstrated that media attention across crises is uneven and often skewed toward specific regions or types of events. Building on this literature, this project extends the analysis by focusing not only on whether coverage is uneven, but on identifying the measurable characteristics that explain variation in media intensity.

Media coverage data is obtained from global event-based news datasets that provide article-level metadata including number of articles mentioning crisis-related keywords, sentiment proxy (tone), publication date, and source country of coverage. These variables allow the construction of crisis-level measures of coverage volume, emotional tone, temporal persistence, and geographic distribution of reporting.

To complement media metadata, crisis-level structural indicators such as fatality counts and humanitarian impact measures are incorporated from standardized conflict and humanitarian databases. All datasets are publicly accessible and either stored directly within the repository or retrieved reproducibly via scripted data downloads to ensure transparency and replicability.
