Data Science assignment
Problem statement 1: 
Which socioeconomic factors (income, employment, education) impact mental health the most, and can 
we predict high-risk neighborhoods for mental health issues using these factors? 
1) What type of problem would you need to solve? 
This is a mixed problem: predictive, classification, exploratory. We need to find correlations 
between income, employment, education, and mental health outcomes and then classify the 
neighborhood into high-risk/low-risk based on these correlation and using this patterns we also 
can forecast the mental health outcomes of the neighborhood. 
2) How will you obtain the data? 
Mental Health Outcomes: 
• CDC BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) or local health department 
surveys. 
Socioeconomic Data: 
• U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS): income, employment, 
education, poverty rates, demographics. 
•  
3) What is the central question you want to answer using data? 
Which socioeconomic factors (income, employment, education) are most strongly associated 
with poor mental health in urban neighborhoods, and can we predict which neighborhoods are 
at highest risk? 
4) Why is this question important within its context? 
Mental health challenges are rising globally, especially in urban environments. This project can 
help identify the neighborhoods that are effected and can forecast the crisis earlier so the 
administration team can plan the resources more efficiently. 
5) What makes this project unique compared to other similar projects? 
Focuses specifically on socioeconomic determinants. Neighborhood-level analysis ensures 
interventions are targeted, not just city-wide averages. 
6) What variables are required, and why are they essential? 
We need income, employment ,education and demographic data to do the analysis for this 
project . 
7) What would a meaningful or successful answer look like? 
• Identification of which socioeconomic factors most strongly influence poor mental 
health. 
• Clear visualizations and maps showing risk distribution across neighborhoods. 
8) Who would use the results, and how would they benefit? 
• City Planners: Decide where to invest in mental health facilities or community programs. 
• Public Health Officials: Target mental health initiatives where the need is greatest. 
9) Is this problem realistic, given typical resource constraints? 
Yes. Datasets are publicly available, Analysis can be done with python and modeling is possible 
Project statement 2:  
Media coverage vs real-world humanitarian severity 
We are exploring whether global media attention reflects the actual severity of humanitarian 
crises, or whether some crises are systematically underreported. 
1.What type of problem would you need to solve? 
This project focuses on data exploration, and we try to examine the patterns in media coverage 
and humanitarian crisis severity. trying to compare trends, distributions, and mismatches. 
2.How will you obtain the data? 
We’ll use two datasets: one from GDELT, showing news coverage of crises, and one from 
humanitarian sources, showing the actual impact, such as affected populations or fatalities. 
3.What is the central question you want to answer using data? 
This project is for NGOs, journalists, and policymakers who want to understand which crises need 
more attention and resources. 
4.Why is this question important within its context? 
It can help highlight underreported crises, guiding media and aid organizations to focus on 
places that need it most. 
5.What makes this project unique compared to other similar projects? 
To compare media attention and real-world impact, identify mismatches, and uncover crises that 
may be overlooked. 
6.What variables are required, and why are they essential? 
•  Media coverage – article counts and mentions to see how much attention each crisis 
gets. 
•  Crisis impact – people affected, fatalities, or displaced to show real severity. 
•  Identifiers – country, region, and date to link the two datasets. 
7.What would a meaningful or successful answer look like? 
A successful answer would show which crises get enough media coverage and which are 
underreported. We’ll use patterns, trends, and simple visualizations to highlight mismatches and 
provide insights that could help journalists or aid organizations focus on the most serious crises. 
8.Who would use the results, and how would they benefit? 
The results would be useful for journalists, NGOs, and policymakers. They could use the insights 
to spot serious crises that are underreported, prioritize coverage or aid, and make more 
informed decisions about where attention and resources are needed most. 
9.Is this problem realistic, given typical resource constraints? 
Yes, this project is realistic. The datasets are publicly available, and we can work with them in 
Python using standard tools. The main challenge is handling large data, but we can focus on a 
subset of crises or a specific time to make it manageable. 
We  chose Problem Statement 1 to proceed further  
Heilmeier Catechism for problem statement 1 : 
1) What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. 
We want to figure out how money, jobs, and education affect people’s mental health in different 
neighborhoods. Using this information, we want to predict which neighborhoods are most at risk of 
mental health problems so resources and support can be targeted effectively. 
2) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? 
Today the Decisions based on mental health are reactive instead of proactive. There is       
of predictive models to guide interventions. 
3) What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful? 
limited use 
Combine public mental health survey data with socioeconomic data at the neighborhood level. The 
project will be successful because the neighborhood-level, data-driven approach is more precise than 
today’s city-wide averages. 
4) Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? 
Who cares: City planners, public health officials, NGOs, and community organizations. 
Difference it will make: 
• Resources like mental health programs or social support can be targeted to neighborhoods most 
in need. 
• Improves mental health outcomes, reduces stress-related problems, and informs evidence-based 
urban planning. 
5) What are the risks? 
• Data limitations: survey or socioeconomic data might be incomplete or outdated and privacy 
concerns. 
• we may need to oversimplify complex mental health factors to make it easier for prediction since 
each person and the spectrum of mental issues are different. 
6) How much will it cost? 
Low cost: mostly involves public datasets and open-source tools 
7) How long will it take? 
This project could realistically take us 2-3 months considering all the data exploration, 
acquisition and cleaning steps, since the data is huge. 
8) What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success? 
Mid-term checks:Data collection, data cleaning and data merging. Initial regression or 
classification models run successfully. 
Final checks:  
• Predictive model identifies high-risk neighborhoods. 
• Feature importance analysis identifies key socioeconomic predictors (income, 
employment, education). 
• Visualizations (maps, charts) clearly highlight risk areas and can guide decision-makers.
